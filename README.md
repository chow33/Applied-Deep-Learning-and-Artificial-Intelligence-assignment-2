# Applied-Deep-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence-assignment-2
In this assignment I have created a semantic search which can find youtube thumpnail image and the title. This is done with a SBERT model and a CLIP model. This is mostly done by creating an API KEY to get acces to youtube video data from youtube itself, which was the hard part, and creating a reference path so the API key doesn't block acces to the data. When that is done, then the retrieval of the important data from youtube is done with a SBERT model to compare the similarity in the searched query and the video in youtube. When this is done, then the semantic search function is created, again with a reference, so it doesn't get blocked from the API key. When the semantic search function is created 2 example with random query is created with a little bit of relevancy to the subject. 

The second part of the assignment is a Gradient Descent Exercise, where i execute the process of updating weights for two examples using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and I document each step, including input calculation, prediction, loss assessment, weight adjustments, and updates. I also do a Attention Mechanism Exercise, where I implement the attention mechanism on two distinct sentences, and choose a sentences with polysmous words to demonstrate its functionality effectively.
